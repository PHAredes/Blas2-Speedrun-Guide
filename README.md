## Goals

The objectives of this project are clarified [here](utils/goals.md).

## Introduction

This repository serves as a central hub for documenting techniques and providing insights into how they can be used to optimize Blasphemous 2 speedruns, regardless of category.

The goal is to promote in-depth game knowledge collaboratively discovered by the speedrunning community in the game. However, it's important to note that this guide is not intended to be an ultimate guide on which routes should be taken. Instead, it aims to share and document what is known and possible in the game at the time of its creation.

Additionally, please be aware that this guide is not definitive, and the knowledge about the game is expected to expand as new runs are completed and new strategies are discovered. It's a non-exhaustive resource, although striving to be as comprehensive as possible is the goal.

## Scene-by-Scene Documentation

In this wiki, we aim to document each scene of the game in detail, including the following information:

- Scene description
- Tricks, glitches, and strategies specific to that scene
- Videos, gifs, and images showcasing these techniques
- Links to related glitches, strats, and scene transitions

Please refer to the individual folders in this repository to access scene-specific documentation.

## Tech Folder

We maintain a directory of techniques, tricks, and glitches used in "Blasphemous 2." Each entry in the directory will include the following:

- Technique name
- Description of the technique
- Video demonstrations (if available)
- Related scenes and scenarios where the technique is applicable

**Notes:**
For a technique to be included in this project, it must be replicable by humans on any unaltered copy of the 1.0.5 version for PC, using either an American layout keyboard or an Xinput-type controller. Techs which requires specific setups as lower fps or tool assist this may be listed with a disclamer. While some techniques might work on other platforms or game versions, they won't be extensively explored within this project.

## Arsenal of Penitence

It is a goal to cover an all in-depth analysis of each weapon at Blasphemous II, listing techniques, damage output and level up and upgrades behavior and implyings.

## Prayers

It is a goal to provide information about any relevant trick involving prayers, for both Quick Verses and Chants.

### Chants

Covers general Chants behavior and an in-depth analysis of both Mirabras of the Return to the Port and Jabera to the Poison of Jealousy. No other prayer have yet been proved to have an different usage from expected none will be covered (until it changes).

### Quick Verses

It is a goal to provide information about verses techniques, divided in two main categories: Hold Verses (for verses you can hold cast button to keep it going) and Throw Verses (for the ones you just press and The Penitent One throw a projectile). Also there will be a dedicated file to cover Bleeding Crown.

## Versions

This is a guide for the Steam version 1.0.5 release
